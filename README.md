# Neural-Nexus-Puzzle
Neural Nexus Puzzle is a sophisticated solution framework for the classic 8-puzzle problem, combining traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with innovative problem-solving strategies and serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of various search algorithms. It requires arranging tiles in a predefined order by sliding them into an empty space
Making it a state-space search problem. This project develops a CPU-based solution to solve the 8-puzzle problem using multiple AI search strategies
